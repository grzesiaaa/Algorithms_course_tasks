# Algorithms and Data Structures - course tasks

## Authors: Julia Grzegorzewska, [Wiktoria Fimińska](https://github.com/fiminka)

## Description 
Assignments for academic course Algorithms and Data Structures at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. Each folder contain different problems solutions which are fully described there. Reports contain step by step instructions and thought process. 

**List 1** - class Fraction
**List 2** - function complexity analysis, Pythagorean triple
**List 3** - Bernoulli distribution, how many multipliplications are needed to calculate the value of the polynomial, check how many times each character occurs in the text file
**List 4** - Queue BaB and BaE, comparison of different implementations of the same data structure, simple experiment using linear data structures, check HTML document correctness, UnorderedList, Stack
**List 5** - experimental analysis of computational complexity, Tower of Hanoi problem, Hilbert curve using **turtle** module, Koch curve
